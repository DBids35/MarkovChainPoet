The following is a generated poem:

Upon the South's rich gift

Of sudden song,

A charmed fountain, swift,

Joyous, and strong. 


There stood the youngest of the two-lane

road and sit beside your feet, my darling, my skittery pigeon. 

Over this damp grave I pass,

And you do it.

He says the body language throws. Thus 

the shape of your Sufi wine.


Prince, where your tall body climbed the hills the joy-fires crept, 

And eager swords within their eyes

a frightful nausea gumming up the steep stream

Some forty feet, and made him for a cure to be downed

By no loose hand, no heart, and I felt for you,

It would have served their fellow-men, 

And the "Ladies' Science Circle" -- 

Just pick a scanty band: 

Desperate, though few, yet full oft I wish I could break the gliding moon.



The feeling heart, and sing.

All things were really in it

Never know just how God randomly 

Scatters the living, but her words to speak,

She formed them on their armour flashing high,

Saint George might waken my shell,

Consign it to every pleading spirit seeking speech but Tiger's barking!

And when she's made to show her wit, yet humble was their magic cell, 

The root is warm to my pain:

Some said that much more strange things about it 

too: I figure that the may and kan,

For tho thre buirnes hym bie;

Now ar thay wente,

And says hur allso:

'Sithin all the blossoms, the tight dress. 

We hand you bread,

With freedom for our own theory of the sister arts combine, 

And thronging round him, but the tarnished copper hair.



My love is unreturned,

Hide thy grief lay hid in the hall; 

And long brown hair

The soft gentleness of arabesques

our life is worthy game for you;

And I am genteel; 

So really, 'tis out of this sort! Himself who chose two times

to kill myself, I seemed to flee into the deep

From ev'ry vale the heavy drapes 

in her dining room table 

sinking his tooth

drinking the pulp

of each fruity turned-up face 

knowing you doomward blown 

before the Snake conspir'd,

Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet keep 

Thy secrets, thou that therein thou may'st frown

In the dark by the steam of beef year round.



One more thing comes back to the universe.

If you can do more.



O raise me high;

They only asked for bread though sour;



By law to words, or sharper face,

With thoughtless mirth we hear.

The last blithe shout hath died upon the wanderer's lay.



Now it's over, and you receive the Azure Cloud, his Charriot, bring

Him to the setting sun.



Cursing only the homeless dark: 

for until ye have captured Lucknow this day;

Therefore strike up the sugar

To put in every land.-

But what see you there, my child, 

(Howe'er that dream may yet holde al hir reed.



A gerland hadde he wonne,

What with his fyerye eye

Torments me soe with burning sand,

Laid waste, destroyed, and the brave,

The mighty of this twilight,

But the great outrage

Of her owne wille.



Ensample of this, death of his lyve, and lande-men such lyuers be.



Of yonge folk is but thine eyes, and his choice;

And receive them the weight of roughly thirteen ton

will rest upon the lone sentinel would start a cold
